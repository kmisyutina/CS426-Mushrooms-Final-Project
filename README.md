Our group's game, Mushrooms Need to Eat to Live, revolves around two
mushrooms trying to gather food for their village.

The terrain of the level is outdoors, because that's where the mushrooms live.
The campfire area is reminiscent of people going camping (where they may
inevitable leave their food behind).

The enemies in this level are bugs like ants and bees, which fits in with
the nature and outdoors theme of this level design. The human walking around
is like a giant. The mushrooms must avoid this obstacle unless they want
to get stepped on.

The mushrooms must try to avoid traps, like the spinning windmind, which can
move resources around and knock the mushrooms off. They must also look around
for hidden areas that may hide more resources, like in high places they cannot
reach but must figure out how to get to those resources.
