Our group's game, Mushrooms Need to Eat to Live, revolves around two
mushrooms trying to gather food for their village.

The terrain of the level is outdoors, because that's where the mushrooms live.
The campfire area is reminiscent of people going camping (where they may
inevitably leave their food behind).

The enemies in this level are bugs, such as ants and bees, which fit in with
the nature and outdoors theme of this level design. The human walking around
is like a giant. The mushrooms must avoid this obstacle unless they want
to get stepped on.

They must look around for hidden areas that may hide more resources, 
like in high places they cannot reach but must figure out how to get 
to those resources. In doing so, they must also watch out for traps,
like the different enemies and the spinning windmill, which moves resources and
knock the mushrooms over.

The sounds in this level are ambient and quiet. The sound of crackling fire,
the sound of a river, and other ambient sounds add to the atmosphere that
this level is set in the outdoors.
